# SpaceX-app

Hi! My name is Dmytro and this is one of my test task created in order to show the stack of technologies I know.

In this project, I used the redux toolkit as the main tool for creating the store and processing it. I used functions to create react components (some companies ask for classes). In order to get information from the server, a regular asynchronous axios request was used. For application routing, I used react router, which made the task much easier. I used Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap for React for this project.

This project is not finished yet, I'm working on it. The tasks I am currently working on are:

- deploying the project to the cloud.
- covering the project with tests and connecting CI / CD.
- also, if there is enough time, I plan to make an authentication form.

Thank you for your attention! Good luck!
